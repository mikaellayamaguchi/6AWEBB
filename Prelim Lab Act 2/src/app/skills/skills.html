      <p class="profile-text">
        As a motivated Web Development student, I have a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. Through hands-on projects, I have developed responsive websites and dynamic web applications, focusing on clean, efficient code and a seamless user experience. I'm eager to apply my skills in a professional environment, where I can continue to learn and contribute to building innovative and user-centered digital solutions. I am currently seeking an internship or junior web developer role where I can further develop my skills, collaborate with experienced professionals, and make a meaningful impact on real-world projects.
